# Multiplayer Real-Time Browser Game
This is a Node.js-based game engine for a multiplayer real-time browser game. Players can join the game, move around the game area, collect feeds, avoid traps, and attack other players.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)
npm (usually comes with Node.js)

git clone https://github.com/meteoncu/nodejs-socketio-multiplayer-realtime-game-engine.git

### Start the game server:
node server.js
The server will start running on the specified port (default is 3000).

## Game Mechanics
Joining the Game: Players can join the game by connecting to the server. They will be assigned a random position in the game area.
Moving: Players can move around the game area by setting a destination. The server will update their position based on their speed.
Feeds: Feeds are randomly placed in the game area. Players can collect feeds to increase their energy.
Traps: Traps are also randomly placed in the game area. Players should avoid traps, as they can reduce their speed and energy.
Attacking: Players can attack other players within a certain range. Successful attacks can reduce the health of the target player.
Scoring: Players earn points by collecting feeds and attacking other players. The game maintains a leaderboard based on the players' scores.

## Configuration
